Infinnovation Stock Exchange Simulator.

A simulator app that simulates Infinnovation Virtual Stock Exchange.
A list of 40 stocks from NSE/BSE are to be used for the simulated stock exchange whose values are fluctuated by the virtual stock exchange's board members. The target audience of the app is participants of Infi-Invest at Infinnovation to provide them with real-time stock updates and thus, allowing them to view news, graphs, other relevant data on the regulated securities/stocks. All fluctuations to the values of the stocks are done through the master panel which is to be used only by the authorised members of the stock exchange board.
